# SourceSmart - Fully transparent supply chain for the public. ðŸ“¦

SourceSmart is a web3 blockchain application that allows the public to track and trace the origin of any registered product, from the raw materials to the final product. 

Buyers and the Suppliers use SourceSmart to register a product as well as its origin, and the consumers use SourceSmart to view the product's origin and verify its authenticity.


**The flow goes as follows:**

1. Buyer creates a contract with the ingredient's details and the supplier's address.
2. Supplier views the contract, accepts it, and adds the ingredient to the contract. (Or rejects it)
3. Buyer receives the goods and finally mark the contract as delivered.
4. QR code is generated, printed on the product and the contract information is accessible to the public.

**Feature Highlights:**

- **Fully transparent supply chain for the public.** If a product supply chain is as [A -> B -> C -> D] each representing a contract, the application provides a tree view that allows you to trace the origin of the product from D to A even though you only have the QR code of D.

- **QR code scanning:**
  1.  When the buyer deploys, a QR code is generated for the supplier to attach to the contract. 
  2.  Supplier can add ingredients to the contract by QR code scanning
  3.  Once the contract is delivered, a QR code is generated for the product. QR code can be printed on the product and scanned by the public to view the entire supply chain.

- **Two blockchains**. Thanks to Reach, the application can be used on both Ethereum and Algorand blockchains.

## Deployed Application

There are 2 versions of our application: One that has `REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE` set to `ALGO` to use with MyAlgo wallet, and another one that has `REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE` set to `ETH` which may use MetaMask. The application is deployed through Vercel on the following links:

## Project Structure

SourceSmart is a React application, and thereby follows the standard React project structure. The main source code is in the `src` folder:

1. `context` - React Context API for global state management
1. `reach-backend` - Reach backend code. Contains `index.rsh` and compiled `index.main.mjs` file.
1. `styles` - CSS file
1. `views` - Pages of the application
1. `App.js` - Entry point of the React application
1. `AppRoutes.js` - React Router routes
1. `Util.js` - Contains common utility functions, mainly the ones that interact with the Reach backend, like API calls, wallet connection, and contract attachment.
